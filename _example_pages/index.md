description: "Runnable Apache Camel Quarkus examples for every pattern category, built with the shipping domain on Podman."
---

Each pattern category has a corresponding runnable Quarkus project under `examples/`. Every example:

- Uses **Apache Camel on Quarkus** with the Java DSL and shipping domain
- Runs against the local **Podman stack** (Kafka, Pulsar, Redis, PostgreSQL)
- Can be started with a single command: `mvn quarkus:dev`

## Getting started

```bash
# Start the infrastructure stack
./scripts/setup-stack.sh

# Run a specific example
cd examples/09-routing-fundamentals
mvn quarkus:dev
```

## Infrastructure

The shared Podman stack provides all backing services:

```bash
# Base stack: Kafka (KRaft), Pulsar, Redis, PostgreSQL, Apicurio, Kafka UI
./scripts/setup-stack.sh

# With observability: Grafana, Loki, Tempo, Mimir, OTel Collector
./scripts/setup-stack.sh --lgtm
```

See [Prerequisites & Setup]({{ '/docs/00-prerequisites/' | relative_url }}) for full environment details.
